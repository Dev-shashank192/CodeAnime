<b><u>History Of Anime:--</u></b><br>
    The history of anime can be traced back to the start of the 20th century, with the 
earliest verifiable films dating from 1907.[1] Before the advent of film, Japan already
had a rich tradition of entertainment with colourful painted figures moving across the
projection screen in utsushi-e (写し絵), a particular Japanese type of magic lantern show
popular in the 19th century. Possibly inspired by European phantasmagoria shows, utsushi-e 
showmen used mechanical slides and developed lightweight wooden projectors (furo) that were 
handheld so that several performers could each control the motions of different projected figures.
The second generation of animators in the late 1910s included Ōten Shimokawa, Jun'ichi Kōuchi 
and Seitaro Kitayama, commonly referred to as the "fathers" of anime.[4] Propaganda films, such
as Momotarō no Umiwashi (1943) and Momotarō: Umi no Shinpei (1945), the latter being the first 
anime feature film, were made during World War II. During the 1970s, anime developed further, with
the inspiration of Disney animators, separating itself from its Western roots, and developing distinct 
genres such as mecha and its super robot subgenre. Typical shows from this period include Astro Boy, Lupin
III and Mazinger Z. During this period several filmmakers became famous, especially Hayao Miyazaki and Mamoru 
Oshii.In the 1980s, anime became mainstream in Japan, experiencing a boom in production with the rise in popularity 
of anime like Gundam, Macross, Dragon Ball, and genres such as real robot, space opera and cyberpunk. Space Battleship
Yamato and The Super Dimension Fortress Macross also achieved worldwide success after being adapted respectively as
Star Blazers and Robotech.The 1988 film Akira went on to become an international success. Later, in 2004, the same creators
produced Steamboy, which became the most expensive anime film. Spirited Away shared the first prize at the 2002 Berlin Film 
Festival and won the 2003 Academy Award for Best Animated Feature,
